          <h2>The Bounty of Liyue's Land and Sea</h2>
          <p>
            Liyue, a region of abundant natural resources, is deeply influenced
            by its diverse landscapes that range from towering mountains to the
            bountiful ocean. The rich soil and favorable climate support a
            variety of crops, including rice, lotus seeds, and diverse
            vegetables, which are staples in Liyue's cuisine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proximity to the sea provides an endless supply of fresh
            seafood, such as fish, shrimp, and crabs, which feature prominently
            in local dishes.

          <h2>Tradition and Festivals: The Heart of Liyue's Cuisine</h2>
          <p>
            Liyue's culinary traditions are deeply intertwined with its cultural
            practices and festivals. The Lantern Rite, a major festival, is a
            prime example where food plays a crucial role in celebrations.
            Families gather to make and enjoy special dishes like Glaze Lily
            Dumplings and Lantern-shaped Rice Cakes, which symbolize prosperity
            and unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            These traditions not only preserve ancient culinary techniques but
            also emphasize the communal aspect of food, where cooking and eating
            are shared experiences that strengthen familial bonds and community
            spirit.

        <h2>The Spice of Trade</h2>
        <p>
          As a major trading hub in Teyvat, Liyue's cuisine is a melting pot of
          flavors and techniques from distant lands. The influx of exotic
          spices, such as star anise and Sichuan pepper, has enriched the local
          cuisine, adding layers of complexity to traditional dishes. The port
          city's openness to new influences is reflected in its vibrant food
          markets, where a diverse array of ingredients and spices are
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blend of local and foreign elements results in a unique culinary
          identity that embraces both tradition and innovation.
